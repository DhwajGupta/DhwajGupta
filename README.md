## âš¡ About Me

Hey there! I'm **Dhwaj Gupta**, a passionate problem solver who leverages technology to make a lasting impact. From many years, I have been exploring the world of coding, and today, I find joy in programming across various languages and technologies. I have had the privilege of working with both large-scale companies and startups.

I am fascinated by the process of building awesome things with code and automating tasks. My current focus lies in **Web & Mobile Development**, where I work with cutting-edge JavaScript frameworks such as **React**, **React Native**, and **NodeJS**. I thrive on pushing boundaries and delivering innovative solutions.

When I'm not coding, I love connecting with amazing individuals from all around the world. I enjoy organizing meetups with friends and family, and I find pleasure in playing strategic games like **chess** and **pool**. I believe in continuous learning and exploring new technologies to stay ahead of the curve.

Let's connect and build something incredible together! Feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn.

Keep innovating, keep coding! ðŸš€ðŸ”¥
