  <h2>âš¡ About Me</h2>
<div align="left">
  <p>Hey there! I'm <strong>Dhwaj Gupta</strong>, a passionate problem solver who leverages technology to make a lasting impact. Since <strong>2010</strong>, I have been exploring the world of coding, and today, I find joy in programming across various languages and technologies. I have had the privilege of working with both large-scale companies and startups.</p>

  <p>I am fascinated by the process of building awesome things with code and automating tasks. My current focus lies in <strong>Web & Mobile Development</strong>, where I work with cutting-edge JavaScript frameworks such as <strong>React</strong>, <strong>React Native</strong>, and <strong>NodeJS</strong>. I thrive on pushing boundaries and delivering innovative solutions.</p>

  <p>When I'm not coding, I love connecting with amazing individuals from all around the world. I enjoy organizing meetups with friends and family, and I find pleasure in playing strategic games like <strong>chess</strong> and <strong>pool</strong>. I believe in continuous learning and exploring new technologies to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
